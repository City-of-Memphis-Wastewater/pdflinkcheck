# I Have Questions.md

## Subject matter: 
How to create a graphical user interface.

## Body: 
When I was about 10 years old I dug through 'C:/Program Files/' repeatedly in a hope to discover how to make a pop-up window.
What defined the edges of an interface? 
Why do some windows look different than others?
How can I add buttons? 

I was excited. I wanted to make something.

Could I mimick code from a software that was installed on my computer?
I checked each folder in 'C:/Program Files/' looking for clues.

As I searched, the questions changed.
What is a DLL?
Why are little icons and fuzzy images the only files I can open and inspect?

I gave up.
Wait - No I didn't. I am here now.

Honestly, I still don't understand where the edges of the window come from.
The easy answer is: **libraries**.
Many people have done a lot of work to build various GUI libraries, to help people like me (and you) build software.

For this package, the application window in built with Tkinter, which is included in Python's standard library.
You can see how the graphical user interface (GUI) is defined at: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/City-of-Memphis-Wastewater/pdflinkcheck/main/src/pdflinkheck/gui.py

This gui.py file isn't perfect, but exploring it will be far more illuminating than trying to open a DLL file in Notepad.
