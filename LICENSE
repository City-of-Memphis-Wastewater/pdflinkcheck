Some distributed binaries of this project include the PyMuPDF library, which is licensed under **AGPL‑3.0‑or‑later**. 
Any binary that incorporates PyMuPDF is therefore distributed under **AGPL‑3.0‑or‑later**. 
Other binaries use only the `pypdf` library and do not include PyMuPDF; these binaries are distributed under the **MIT License**.

For AGPL‑licensed binaries, the complete corresponding source code must be made available to anyone who possesses a copy, upon request. 
This obligation applies only to recipients of those binaries, and hosting the source code in GitHub Releases satisfies this requirement.

A binary becomes AGPL‑licensed only when built with the optional `"mupdf"` dependency group (as defined in `pyproject.toml` under `[project.optional-dependencies]`) or when PyMuPDF is otherwise included in the build environment. 
The **source code of pdflinkcheck itself** remains licensed under the **MIT License**; only the distributed binary becomes AGPL‑licensed when PyMuPDF is included.

Source code for each released version is available in the `pdflinkcheck‑VERSION.tar.gz` files on the project’s GitHub Releases page.
